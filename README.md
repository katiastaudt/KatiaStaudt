### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a professional looking for a new position in â€‹â€‹mobile development area to interact alone or with a team, building new software or improving functionalities already exist, looking for a best solution to apply in the app.
I've been preparing for almost a year to change my profession and I believe I'm ready to start my career.
I have a long experience of social and professional life, now I am looking for new challenges and I will certainly learn even more from the younger ones who have a huge background in the area of â€‹â€‹technology.
